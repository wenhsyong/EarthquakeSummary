EarthquakeSummary Application Workflow
======================================

1. On launching the application the following two items are retrieved from the application configuration:

   a. USGS GeoJSON past hour earthquake summary feeds url
   b. worldcities.csv (can be downloaded from http://www.opengeocode.org/download/worldcities.zip). This file is assumed located at default folder "C:\USGS Earthquake Summary\",
      but is configurable. If this file does not exist, the application will terminate after showing a reminder message.

2. A worker thread is then launched to build a 2D kd-tree using (latitude, longitude) of all cities available in worldcities.csv. The tree is buiilt only once during the 
   application life cycle.

3. A worker thread is launched parallel to the one before to retrieve USGS GeoJSON feed, then wait until kd-tree thread to finish. For each earthquake location, the kd-tree is searched for the three 
   nearest cities. Each eqrthquake location with its magnitude, coordinates, local time and depth, along with the name and coordinate of the three nearest cities are then displayed in 
   a listbox. 

4. A timer is set up to repeat the work item 3 above every hour until the application is terminated by the user.

5. The status bar shows simple status for each event.
